## Implementation approach

We will leverage Python's built-in libraries such as `curses` for handling the command-line interface and keyboard inputs. The game will be structured around a main game loop that updates the game state, processes user input, and renders the game screen. We will avoid complex dependencies and focus on a simple, yet efficient implementation that meets the original requirements and allows for easy future enhancements.

## Data structures and interfaces

classDiagram
    class Main {
        +main() void
    }
    class Game {
        -Snake snake
        -Food food
        -Scoreboard scoreboard
        -game_over bool
        +start_game() void
        +game_loop() void
        +end_game() void
    }
    class Snake {
        -body list
        -direction string
        +change_direction(new_direction: string) void
        +move() bool
        +grow() void
    }
    class Food {
        -position tuple
        +relocate() void
    }
    class Scoreboard {
        -score int
        -high_score int
        +update_score(points: int) void
        +display_score() void
    }
    Main --> Game
    Game --> Snake
    Game --> Food
    Game --> Scoreboard

## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant SB as Scoreboard
    M->>G: start_game()
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move()
        alt Snake eats food
            S->>S: grow()
            G->>F: relocate()
            G->>SB: update_score(points)
        end
        G->>SB: display_score()
        G->>G: game_loop()
        alt Game Over
            G->>G: end_game()
        end
    end

## Anything UNCLEAR

The method for increasing the snake's speed after consuming food is not specified. We will implement a speed increase mechanism within the Snake class that is triggered by the Game class after food consumption. Further clarification may be needed on the exact speed increment values and intervals.
